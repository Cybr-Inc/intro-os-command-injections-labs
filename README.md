# Introduction to OS Command Injections Labs
Welcome to Cybr's Introduction to OS Command Injections hands-on demonstrations and resources repository. Here, you will find a list of hands-on demos [we performed in our free course](https://cybr.com/courses/introduction-to-os-command-injections/) as well as additional resources.
1. Setting up our lab environment
2. Attacking web apps manually
3. Automated attacks with Commix
4. Creating and exploiting backdoor shells
5. Additional resources

Please note that these steps are meant to be performed in the lab environment we create in #1, but of course you are free to create your own custom environment. The reason for this is that performing these actions on resources you do not own or have explicit permissions for can be considered illegal and could get you in trouble. Also, performing attacks like these can cause damages to production applications, and so creating an isolated environment helps protect against that since we can start over if we need to, without impacting users.

I hope you enjoy these labs! Happy learning!
